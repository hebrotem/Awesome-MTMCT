In the visual tracking community, the dominant research focus used to be around tracking either a single object (SOT) or multiple objects (MOT) within a single camera. However, with the increasing adoption of multi-camera networks across various applications, the demand for multi-camera tracking systems has surged, surpassing the usage of single cameras [1].

We provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of visual object tracking in multi-camera settings. The study analyzes and categorize existing works based on six crucial facets: problem formulation, adopted problem solving approach, data association requirements, mutual exclusion constraints, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics.
