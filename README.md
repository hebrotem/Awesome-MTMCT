In the visual tracking community, the dominant research focus used to be around tracking either a single object (SOT) or multiple objects (MOT) within a single camera. However, with the increasing adoption of multi-camera networks across various applications, the demand for multi-camera tracking systems has surged, surpassing the usage of single cameras [1].

We provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of visual object tracking in multi-camera settings. The study analyzes and categorize existing works based on six crucial facets: problem formulation, adopted problem solving approach, data association requirements, mutual exclusion constraints, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics.

## News
- [2023-07-11] ðŸ”¥ We have released this repository that collects the resources related to GNNs for time series analysis (GNN4TS). We will keep updating this repository, and welcome to **STAR** and **WATCH** to keep track of it.
 
- [2023-07-08] ðŸ”¥ Our review paper with the title "Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking: A Review of Current Trends and Future Advances" (*ver. 06 Jul*) was accepted for publication in **Neurocomputing**
